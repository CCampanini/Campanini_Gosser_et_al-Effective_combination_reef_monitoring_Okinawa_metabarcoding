# UPGRADE NEEDED | Observer-based and eDNA metabarcoding techniques to survey reefs exposed to different levels of anthropogenic pressure around Okinawa, Japan 

The data in this repository were collected during a monitoring campaign in may-june 2022 along Okinawajima's and Akajima's coastline, Japan, and resulted from Claudia Campanini's MSc thesis project for the International Master of Science in Marine Biological resources (IMBRSea), entitled *"VISIBLE DISTRESS ON THE REEF | Benthic multi-taxa survey for reef monitoring and impact assessment in Okinawa (Japan)"*, which included only a subset of the current data. 
The project was carried out under the supervision of Professor James Davis Reimer, Molecular Invertebrate Systematics and Ecology (MISE) lab, University of the Ryukyus, Okinawa, Japan.

## Aims of the thesis project

This study aims to test a multi-taxa protocol that combined both observer-based and eDNA techniques for reef monitoring and impact assessment: 
- suggesting possible indicator taxa for future monitoring campaigns
- providing both a qualitative and a quantitative estimate of the difference in benthic community among sites exposed to different levels of anthropogenic pressure. 

## Project summary

Coral reefs all over the world suffer from the cumulative impacts of anthropogenic pressures acting both at local and global scales. Considering the importance of reefs in terms of biodiversity and ecosystem services provided, adopting an effective monitoring protocol contribute to its conservation and management.
In recent years, different studies tested the use of environmental DNA and metabarcoding in conjunction with ongoing monitoring techniques, e.g. morphological assessments, visual/video surveillance. Compared to traditional methods, the eDNA metabarcoding approach has many practical advantages such as being non-invasive, time-, and cost-efficient. In terms of results, it allows the characterization of a wider spectrum of organisms present in biological communities, including microbes; moreover, it facilitates the detection of cryptic and nocturnal species. It has also been applied for early detections of alien species. Nevertheless, the integration of eDNA metabarcoding with existing survey protocols needs to be validated with pilot studies aiming at standardizing experimental design, laboratory analyses, and bioinformatic workflows.
Most coral reefs in Japan are in the southern archipelago of the Ryukyus. Okinawajima is the most populated and developed island of the archipelago, and the island’s fringing reefs’ proximity to the coast make them particularly exposed to local anthropogenic stressors, e.g. coastal development, tourism, and terrestrial runoff. West of Okinawajima, Akajima Island in the Kerama Islands is part of the Keramashoto National Park and direct human impacts are much reduced.
In this study, a benthic multi-taxa survey coupled with eDNA sampling was tested at two depth levels at 12 locations along Okinawajima and Akajima islands. The protocol combined a) Photo Line Intercept Transects (PLITs) to examine the relative benthic cover, b) belt transects with pictures for identification of mollusk and echinoderm diversity and abundance, c) diver-operated videos to estimate fish diversity and abundance, and d) water sampling at depth for eDNA. To gather information on the composition of animal assemblages at each site, a universal metazoan primer targeting the COI region was used for eDNA analysis.
Each site was characterized with environmental variables from satellite data. Cumulative exposure to anthropogenic pressures was estimated using a scores-based scale. Of the 12 locations, 7 were classified as impacted and 5 as pristine.
The monitoring protocol was relatively inexpensive, fast, and could be utilized by volunteers. Consequently, this method could be adopted in large-scale monitoring campaigns, improving the knowledge on reefs’ status. Monitoring is essential for the implementation of evidence-based management and conservation, which are high-priority especially for the degraded reefs along Okinawajima Island. Thus, this project have four main objectives: 1) characterize differences in community composition and functions among impacted and pristine sites; 2) observe the differences in community composition and impacts at different depths; 3) assess whether the eDNA signal is localized and how it changes with distance among different sites; and 4) test a protocol that combines metazoan metabarcoding from eDNA with observer-based techniques for an eventual implementation of current monitoring protocols.
